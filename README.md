# Chip-8 emulator

This project implements GUI emulator that allows you to play Chip-8 games.

## Prerequisites

If you would like to compile the program, you will need several two libraries configured:

* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) - used to create a simple user interface and sound effects (beep!)
* [FLTK](https://www.fltk.org/) - used to create a platform-native file picker

ALl the requirements regarding placement of the above libraries can be found in solution properties.
